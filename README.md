For DS201, we were given creative and dataset freedom to undergo the full Data Science process from end-to-end. This included choosing a dataset or scraping your own from the web, cleaning the data, conducting analyses,
visualizations, machine learning, and communicating the observations or findings. For my project, I chose a dataset from Kaggle--which will be linked--to observe mental health in the technology sector. Though I have not
worked much with categorical data, this was a challenging and insighful project where I learned to put my statistical knowledge into application. There were various columns that could have produced statistically significant
findings, as mine did not. However, I am satisfied with the columns I chose as it enabled me to learn that not all research, findings, or variables will have significant relationships and you must further your observations to
discover.
